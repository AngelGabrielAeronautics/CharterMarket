# Firebase Storage CORS Error Fix

## Problem
Console errors showing CORS policy violations when loading aircraft images from Firebase Storage:
```
Access to image at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/charter-ef2c2.firebasestorage.app...' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
Firebase Storage buckets require explicit CORS configuration to allow direct image requests from web applications. During development, the browser blocks cross-origin requests to Firebase Storage URLs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Image Proxy API Route (`/api/image-proxy`)
- **File**: `src/app/api/image-proxy/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Server-side proxy that fetches Firebase Storage images and serves them with proper CORS headers
- **Usage**: `GET /api/image-proxy?url=<encoded-firebase-storage-url>`
- **Security**: Validates that URLs are from Firebase Storage domains only

### 2. Image Utility Functions (`src/utils/image-utils.ts`)
- **`getImageUrl()`**: Automatically uses proxy in development, direct URLs in production
- **`getNextImageUrl()`**: Version optimized for Next.js Image components
- **`isFirebaseStorageUrl()`**: Validates Firebase Storage URLs
- **`shouldUseProxy()`**: Environment-based proxy decision

### 3. Component Updates
Updated all components that display Firebase Storage images:

#### `AircraftDetailsModal.tsx`
- Avatar image: Added type checking and proxy support
- Image gallery: Filtered File objects and used proxy for string URLs

#### `AircraftImageGallery.tsx`
- Next.js Image component: Uses `getNextImageUrl()` for proper proxy handling

#### `AircraftSearch.tsx`
- CardMedia component: Added type checking and proxy support for aircraft thumbnails

#### `ImprovedAircraftImageUpload.tsx`
- Form preview images: Uses proxy for string URLs, keeps blob URLs for File objects

### 4. Type Safety
- All components now properly handle `(string | File)[]` union types
- Type guards ensure only string URLs are processed by proxy
- File objects continue using blob URLs for immediate preview

## Development vs Production

### Development (localhost:3000)
- All Firebase Storage images routed through `/api/image-proxy`
- Eliminates CORS errors during local development
- Slightly slower image loading due to proxy overhead

### Production (Vercel deployment)
- Direct Firebase Storage URLs used (no proxy)
- Optimal performance and caching
- Firebase Storage serves images directly to browsers

## Benefits
1. **No CORS errors**: Images load properly in development
2. **Type safe**: Proper handling of File vs string URL types
3. **Performance optimized**: Proxy only used when necessary
4. **Security**: URL validation prevents abuse of proxy endpoint
5. **Transparent**: Components work the same in dev and production

## Testing
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to aircraft management page
3. Check browser console - no more CORS errors
4. Verify images load properly in:
   - Aircraft list/search results
   - Aircraft detail modals
   - Aircraft edit forms
   - Image upload previews

## Future Considerations
- Consider configuring Firebase Storage CORS rules for direct access
- Monitor proxy endpoint performance and add caching if needed
- Add error handling and fallback images for failed loads
